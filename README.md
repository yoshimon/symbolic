**symbolic** is a flexible compiler front-end for creating custom, C-style Domain Specific Languages (DSL) that doesn't require any changes to cover a variety of target languages. This allows the target DSL to be cleanly separated from the lexing and parsing process. Any compatible, C-style DSL can be implemented using symbolic libraries and a custom compiler backend, that translates the symbolic intermediate representation (IR) to a target platform.
